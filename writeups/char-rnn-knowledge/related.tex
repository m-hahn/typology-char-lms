\paragraph{Character-based neural language models} Character-level
RNN-based language models have received some attention in the last
decade because of their potential greater generality with respect to
word-based models, as well because, intuitively, they should be able
to use cues, such as morphological information, that word-based models
miss by design. Early studies such as \newcite{Mikolov:etal:2011},
\newcite{Sutskever:etal:2011} and \newcite{Graves:2014} established
that CNLMs are in general not as good at language modeling as their
word-based counterparts, but lag only slightly
behind. \newcite{Sutskever:etal:2011} and \newcite{Graves:2014}
presented informal qualitative analysis showing that the CNLMs are
learning basic linguistic properties of their input. The latter, who
trained LSTM models, also showed that CNLMs can keep track to some
extent of hierarchical structure, as showing by their ability to
correctly balance parentheses when generating text. Our aim here is to
understand to what extent CNLMs trained on unsegmented input learn
various linguistic constructs. This is different from much work in the
area, that has focused on \emph{character-aware} architectures, that
combine in various ways character- and word-level information, with
the goal to develop state-of-the-art language models, also effective
in morphologically rich languages \citep[see, e.g.,][and references
there]{Bojanowski:etal:2016,Kim:etal:2016,Gerz:etal:2018}.


\begin{itemize}
\item Character-based language models; emphasize:
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item these models are not as good as word-based model
    perplexity-wise, but they have a more challenging task (they must
    explore a much wider possible-utterance space);
  \item lots of work on improving these models, in order to get better
    performance on morphologically rich languages etc: different from
    what we want to do, which is to probe the simplest CNLMs;
  \item Elman's might be most related in spirit, but just small toy
    experiment
  \end{inparaenum}
\item Work on discovering segmentation, in particular with CNLMs:
  clearly different
\item Work on understanding linguistic knowledge of NLMs: typically
  for word-based models
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Closer to us Alishahi et al.~2017, but they focus on a more
    complex architecture for grounded language learning, and on
    phonology
  \item Radford et al.~2017 probe CNLMs, but limited to sentement
    analysis
  \end{itemize}
\item What else?
\end{itemize}


\cite{Kim:etal:2016}, \cite{Gerz:etal:2018}: examples of
``character-aware'' model, good to improve performance, but not what
we analyze here. Latter paper good to cite for survey and state of the
art. \cite{Bojanowski:etal:2016}: might be mentioned for showing that
performance is worse than word-RNN. \cite{Radford:etal:2017}: more
precisely byte-based model, show good performance of CNLM as feature
extractor, and does some qualitative analysis, in particular finding
that sentiment is localistically encoded in a single cell. Early work
showing that CLNMs can be used for language modeling, although they
lag somewhat behind word models: \cite{Mikolov:etal:2011},
\cite{Sutskever:etal:2011} (the latter with some qualitative
analysis), \cite{Graves:2014} shows LSTM-based CLNMs to be only
slightly worse than word-based one, and showed qualitatively they
generate text with interesting properties, such as correctly balancing
parentheses. Closest to \cite{Alishahi:etal:2017}, but they focus on a
more complex architecture for grounded language learning, and on
phonology.
